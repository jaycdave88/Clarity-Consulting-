## Clarity Conference
***

- Was created in ASP.NET MVC using the Entity Framework to allow a user to view attendees to the a conference and join themselves or add a new client to the list of companies attending

- Please note - I did NOT include any of the packages with my upload to GitHub, build the project with Visual Studio to add the packages.
